  utter_corona_intro:
    - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
        and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
        can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
        predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
        and COVID-19. The virus induces symptoms like Fever, dry coughs, chills, shortness of breath , tiredness etc.
        Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.
        These estimates will be updated as more data become available.
  utter_corona_spread:
    - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
      \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
      \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
      \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
      \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
      \ is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19\
      \ can spread the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients\
      \ be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they\
      \ are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.\n\
      How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release\
      \ someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with\
      \ doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials\
      \ and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,\
      \ illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.\n\
      The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably\
      \ in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community\
      \ spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including\
      \ some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
  utter_corona_food_spread:
    - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
        respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
        of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
        to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
        safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
        or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
    - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
        COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
        cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
        these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
        spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
        more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
        with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
    - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
        may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
        who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
        Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
        Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease etc.
  utter_symptom_check_link:
    - text: The virus induces symptoms like Fever, dry coughs, chills, shortness of breath etc.The incubation period is 28 days.
